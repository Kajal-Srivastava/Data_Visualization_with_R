# Case Study 1: Visualizing the Impact of Vaccination Programs on Infectious Diseases in California

This project visualizes the powerful impact of vaccination programs or herd immunization on reducing infectious disease rates in California.

**Background**:- The analysis focuses on Measles incidence rates per 100,000 population, visualizing trends in Measles cases observed before and after the introduction of the Measles vaccine in 1963 for "California" alone. The Line graph is utilized to show the trend before and after 1963.

**Key highlights:**
1.	Cleaned and aggregated historical data using R by utilizing filter() and mutate() .
2.	Applied ggplot2 and geom_line() to plot the line graph for Measles cases in California.
3.	Demonstrated how clear visualizations can combat misinformation by showing the dramatic decline in disease rates post-vaccination and creating a vertical line for year = 1963 using xintercept = 1963 argument for geom_vline() i.e. the year when vaccination was introduced. This clearly shows how California showed decline in measles cases drastically after introduction of the vaccine.
